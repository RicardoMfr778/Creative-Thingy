Creative Projects that I've built along the way

Project 1 - RGB-LED Projector.

Since I wanted to practice electronic circuitry skills, as well as learn a new language 
I came up with the idea of building my own RGB-LED projector with Various modes, such as
Rainbow , Flash, Hot/Cold gradient, Choose-a-color mode. 
This Project has a 3D schematic for the projector itself, C code to control Arduino and 
also Java code for Android to control the projector via Bluetooth.
